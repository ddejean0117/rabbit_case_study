## Overview and Origin
* [Rabbit Inc.](https://www.rabbit.tech/) was founded in 2022 by Jesse Lyu Cheng, who had in 2017 sold startup Raven Tech (maker of virtual assistants) to Chinese tech giant Baidu. (1)(2)(3)

* Lyu had lost the emotional connection with his phone, and wanted to fix that user experience. Given the high barrier of entry to the phone market, he decided *against* creating a phone and instead to create something to help other established phones. But rather than creating a software based app, he created a walkie talkie like piece of hardware - he did this both to protect his company's IP, and to give the user a sesnse of physical familiarity to accompany the disruptive new technology. (3)

* Rabbit initially raised $30M from Khosla Ventures and other investors. (4) The company's flagship product, the Rabbit R1,   sells at a unit price of $199.

## Business Activities

* The R1 is Rabbit's attempt to address the poor user interface with smartphones. It allows users to be less distracted by their phones doing repetitive, mundane functions, and more immersed in their environment. It is intended for anyone who has a smart phone, with the number of smartphone users expected to reach 7.1 billion in 2024. (5)

* Because Rabbit lauched a piece of hardware that is *separate* from any phone, their software (AI interface executed with LAM rabbits/agents) is not viewable by Apple or Android as it would be had they had made an app on an app store. Competitors could make a similar product from scratch, but the hardware solution has a higher barrier to entry becuase of the greater cost and complexity that goes along with manufacturing. 

    >“We knew that the large action model is like [Apple’s] multitouch. It’s so good that we’re gonna protect it to the point that we want to build dedicated hardware just to run it,” [Lyu] says. “And then the hardware is a result of de-risk. We don’t want to offer you two new things. We want to offer you one thing [AI] and the other thing [an amusing retro-future gadget] that takes you back to the ’90s, the good old fun times.” (3)

* The AI Pin made by Humane offers a similar hardware product, but with a more expensive upfront cost ($699 vs. $199) and with a $24 monthly subscription that the R1 doesn't have. (6)  However, even Lyu has admitted that Apple, Android, or any othe phone manufacturer could create something similar within their platforms and eliminate the [R1]] device altogether. To that point, some users have been able to bootleg the Android Package Kit (APK) and replicate the service in a phone-based app. (7) That begs the question, who will need a secondary device that is more expensive than a typical app? And perhaps the bigger question is, does an AI interface eliminate the need for apps at all? (8) Time will tell.

* The R1 leverages Large Action Model (LAM) technology, which enhances the predictive language modelling of Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand complex reasoning and execute tasks. (8) It also imploys cloud-based processing, to cut down on hardware and provide more security for user data.

## Landscape

* The Rabbit R1 is in the AI wearable devices field. This field has experienced significant growth, driven by health, fitness and personal technology devices. More intuitive interfaces are allowing users to interact less with their devices and more with their environment, removing the intrusiveness of technology. (9)

* Other major companies in this field include Humane (maker of the AI pin mentioned above), and AI Shiffman (maker of the Tab) (9). 

## Results

* So far, Rabbit has offered the most affordable attempt yet in a shift away from app-based interfaces to more intuitive and less intrusive smart technology. Because it convincingly challenges the need for apps, it is creating a tension with the numerous companies that rely on the app-based financial model. It is not a matter of whether the user will win, but how quickly and disruptively.  

* Here's how Rabbit Inc. is performing relative to competitors in the same field:
    - Rabbit as a business:
        - Revenue - 100,000 preorders and over $20 million in revenue. (4) That's more than the 10,000 units sold and $7M in revenue that the AI Pin brought in. (10)
        - Profit margin - The R! has "considerable margins to spend on some AI processing it outsources" (3)
        - IP protection - cloud based computing, which is industry standard for AI devices
        - Barrier to entry - noticable effort to design/manufacture hardware vs. just software
        - Brand Loyalty - too early to say for sure, but given that there is a real question into the necessity of a seecondary hardware device, loyalty is a difficult jump.
        - Scalability - Lyu has mentioned user training for rabbit devevelopmnt (much like app development on phones) may be where Rabbit R1 reaches scalability. (3) This may be where LAM-based products have a leg up on their competition.

    - R1 device value to user: 
        - Environmental navigation - Huge assist with phone interface; less of a generalist when it comes to overall environment. How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
        - Reliability - So new that reliabiltiy data isn't available. However, the simplicity of the device design (and keeping the processing in the cloud) bodes well. However, the AI Pin competitor has even less hardware (no screen), so may hae a leg up. Pratical application may be more positive than the rival AI pin, which has been critsized for its battery life. (10)
        - Accuracy - Again, so new that accuracy data is not available
        - Cost - definte industry leader with device cost, as mentioned above
        - Data security - industry standard, cloud computing
        - Intrusiveness - Not competitive, given that it adds a second device to smartphone users

## Recommendations

* A prudent recommendation for Rabbit would be to develop a physical **ambient computing hardware product** with a platform leveraging **cloud computing** for a high level of data security, and implementing **LAM technology** to bypass the need for apps. This would disrupt the multi-billion dollar smartphone industry by offering a better user experience through a simplified, more efficient and more secure user interface with technology.

* LAMs, cloud computing and ambient computing are all technologies that reduce user disruption while increasing personal environmental navigation, and making the user-tech interface more effective, efficient and secure. The addition of ambient computing to the Rabbit's existing technology would add passive/experiential learning, further reducing the user's technology intrusion.
