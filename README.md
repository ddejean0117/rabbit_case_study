# TITLE

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
Rabbit Inc
* When was the company incorporated?
2022 (2)
* Who are the founders of the company?
Jesse Lyu Cheng, who had in 2017 sold startup Raven Tech (virtual assistants) to Chinese tech giant Baidu. (2) (3)
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Lyu had lost the emotional connection with his phone, and wanted to fix that user experience. Given the high barrier of entry to the phone market, he decided against creating a phone and instead to create something to help other established phones. But rather than creating a software based app, he created a walkie talkie like piece of hardware - he did this both to protect his company's IP, and to give the user a sesnse of physical familiarity to accompany the disruptive new technology. (3)
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Rabbit initially raised $30M from Khosla Ventures and other investors. (4) Rabbit R1 units now sell at $200 each.
## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Poor user interface with phones - the user has to repeat mundane functions every time they use an app.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Anyone who has a smart phone. The number of smartphone users is expected to reach 7.1 billion in 2024. (4)

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Because Rabbit lauched a piece of hardware that is separate from the phone, their software IP (AI interface executed with LAM rabbits/agents) is not viewable by Apple or Android as it would be if someone had just made an app on an app store. Someone could make a similar product from scratch, but the hardware solution has a higher barrier to entry becuase of the greater cost and complexity. The AI Pin made by Humane offers a similar hardware product, but with a more expensive upfront cost ($700 vs. $200) and with a $24 monthly subscription that the R1 doesn't have. (6)  However, even Lyu has admitted that Apple, Android, or any othe phone manufacturer could create something similar within their platforms and eliminate the second device altogether. To that point, some users have been able to bootleg the APK and replicate the service in an in-phone app. (7) That begs the question, why will I need this secondary device that is more expensive than a typical app? Perhaps the bigger question is, does an AI interface eliminate the need for apps at all? (8)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
- Large Action Model (LAM), which enhances the predictive language modelling of Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand complex reasoning and execute tasks. (8)
- cloud-based processing, to cut down on hardware and provide more security

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
AI wearable devices

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
This field has experienced significant growth, driven by health, fitness and personal technology devices. More intuitive interfaces are allowing users to interact less with their devices and more with their environment, removing the intrusiveness of technology. (9)

* What are the other major companies in this field?
Humane (AI pin), AI Shiffman (Tab) (9)
## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Rabbit has offered the most affordable attempt yet in a shift away from app-based interfaces to more intuitive and less intrusive technology that enhances the user's life. Because it convincingly challenges the need for apps, it is creating a tension with the numerous companies that rely on the app-based financial model. It is not a matter of whether the user will win, but how quickly and disruptively.  

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics? How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
Device/ value to user: 
- Environmental navigation - Huge assist with phone interface; less of a generalist when it comes to overall environment. How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
- Reliability - So new that reliabiltiy data isn't available. However, the simplicity of the device design (and keeping the processing in the cloud) bodes well. However, the AI Pin competitor has even less hardware (no screen), so may hae a leg up. Pratical application may be more positive than the rival AI pin, which has been critsized for its battery life. (10)
- accuracy - Again, so new that accuracy data is not available
- Cost - definte industry leader with device cost
- Data security - industry standard, cloud computing
- intrusiveness - Not competitive, given that it adds a second device

Business
- revenue - 100,000 preorders and over $20 million in revenue. (4) That's more than the 10,000 units sold and $7M in revenue that the AI Pin brought in. (10)
- Profit margin - "considerable margins to spend on some AI processing it outsources" (3)
- IP protection - cloud based computing, which is industry standard for AI devices
- Barrier to entry - noticable effort to design/manufacture hardware vs. just software
- Brand Loyalty - too early to say for sure, but given that there is a real question into the necessity of a seecondary hardware device, loyalty is a difficult jump.
- Scalability - Lyu has mentioned user training for rabbit devevelopmnt (much like app development on phones) may be where Rabbit R1 reaches scalability. (3) This may be where LAM-based products have a leg up on their competition.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
Develop a physical ambient computing product/platform with a high level of data security that bypasses the need for apps.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
This would disrupt the multi-billion dollar smartphone industry by offering a better user experience through a simplified, more efficient and more secure user interface with technology.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
- LAM
- Cloud computing
- Ambient computing



* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
- all are based in reducing user disruption while increasing personal environmental navigation; and making the user-tech interface more effective, efficient and secure. The addition of ambient computing to the Rabbit's existing technology would add passive/experiential learning, further reducing the user's technology intrusion.
